    <h2>Buy/Sell</h2>
    <p>
        As a part of this project we are trying to classify companies which top performing stocks. Here we are
        using listed API’s to fetch data and run a logic to find the top companies for stock investments. A simple
        way to measure price momentum is to consider the proximity of a stock to its 52-week high or low adjustement prices.
        The formula I used for this was current price minus 52-week low divided by 52-week high minus 52-week low.
        Stocks that score 82% or higher on this formula tend to outperform, while stocks that score 41% or lower tend to underperform.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this we have used an api which is a batch request to get the stats of all the 8737 companies using the api and we apply the above mentioned logic on the data</br>
        api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/batch?symbols=" + symbols + "&types=quote&filter=symbol,companyName,close,week52High,week52Low";
        </br> table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">stockSuggest</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Top Gainers</h2>
    <p>
        This API provides the top gainers in the stock market.
        </br> api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/collection/sector?collectionName=Health%20Care
        </br> table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">GainersList</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Sector Performance</h2>
    <p>
        This gives us the sector wise information as well as the list of sectors in the stock market, for example all health care firms are clubbed into one sector.
        </br>api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/sector-performance
        </br>table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">Sector</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Financials</h2>
    <p>
        This gives us the quarterly data of companies such as current assets total revenue and shareholder equity etc for all the companies.
        Like for the company Apple we use the below api.
        </br> api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/aapl/financials
        </br> table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">FinancialList</span>

    <h1><u>Improvements</u></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Bug-fix: The error in the base application when "Save" button is clicked twice has been resolved</li>
        <li>Made minor changes in model to get the Company name in the views</li>
        <li>Minor UI changes</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><u>Self-Reflection</u></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Basically, while developing the web application we learnt how an API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when programming graphical user interface (GUI) components. </li>
        <li>We learnt who to create customized views, and how MVC renders HTML application without the need for writing any user interface code by means of a small set of generic View and Controller classes.</li>
        <li>This project allowed us to gain insight about entity framework starting from the data population in cloud database to efficient mapping in controller.</li>
        <li>With azure we were able to setup cloud database where we encountered a lot of challenges about data integration, this setup helped us device methodologies how the table should interact just the it is in RDBMS.</li>
        <li>In this project we learnt how to deploy a website and since the graphic user interface is one of the crucial aspects of website development, we tried to intuitive navigation to create better user interface experience. </li>
        <li>It took us almost 25 hours to complete the Assignment</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
