    <h2>Buy/Sell</h2>
    <p>
        As a part of this project we are trying to classify companies which top performing stocks. Here we are
        using listed API’s to fetch data and run a logic to find the top companies for stock investments. A simple
        way to measure price momentum is to consider the proximity of a stock to its 52-week high or low.
        The formula I used for this was current price minus 52-week low divided by 52-week high minus 52-week low.
        Stocks that score 82% or higher on this formula tend to outperform, while stocks that score 41% or lower tend to underperform.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this we have used an api which is a batch request to get the stats of all the 8737 companies using the api and we apply the above mentioned logic on the data</br>
        api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/batch?symbols=" + symbols + "&types=quote&filter=symbol,companyName,close,week52High,week52Low";
        </br> table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">stockSuggest</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Top Gainers</h2>
    <p>
        This API provides the top gainers in the stock market.
        </br> api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/collection/sector?collectionName=Health%20Care
        </br> table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">GainersList</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Sector Performance</h2>
    <p>
        This gives us the sector wise information as well as the list of sectors in the stock market, for example all health care firms are clubbed into one sector.
        </br>api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/sector-performance
        </br>table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">Sector</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Sector Specific</h2>
    <p>
        This API gets the data of all the companies from a specific sector. We are using collections with sector performance to get the mapping from sector to companies.
        like for the Health Care Sector we use the below api.
        </br> api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/market/collection/sector?collectionName=Health%20Care
    </p>
    <h2>Financials</h2>
    <p>
        This gives us the quarterly data of companies such as current assets total revenue and shareholder equity etc for all the companies.
        Like for the company Apple we use the below api.
        </br> api: https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/aapl/financials
        </br> table: <span style="font-weight:bolder">FinancialList</span>
